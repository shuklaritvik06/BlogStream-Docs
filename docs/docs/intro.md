# Introduction

BlogStream has a vision of supporting blog writers, and crypto can be of great help in this. So a team of three members of our community, [Sreekar Sarvepalli](https://github.com/sreekar9601), [Abhinav MV](https://github.com/AbhinavMV), [David Kim](https://github.com/hyomiTheTech) formed a team together and build blogstream.


⚡️ BlogStream is for everyone.

💸 Readers can support the creators they love and also become one themselves.

💥 Some more cool features would be added with time.
